# NeuralNetwork_XOR_Backprop
This script demonstrates the implementation of a simple neural network using the backpropagation algorithm for the XOR problem. The network has a 3-4-1 architecture, consisting of an input layer with 3 neurons, a hidden layer with 4 neurons, and an output layer with 1 neuron.
